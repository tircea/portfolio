The cat chased the rat through the old house. It was cold and silent, with broken windows and dusty floors.
Children used to live there, but now only memories remain. The cat sat on the window sill and waited.
The rat appeared from under the floorboards and darted across the room. The chase began again.
Outside, the wind howled, and the rain tapped against the glass. In that lonely house, two shadows moved â€”
one in pursuit, the other escaping. Over and over, day and night, they repeated the same quiet ritual.
